I work as a Security Researcher at [ANSII](ssi.gouv.fr), the National Cybersecurity Agency of France.
My research focuses on firmwares, trusted environment and secure boot mechanisms.

I was previously a Senior Software Engineer at Google Paris, working on [Fuchsia](fuchsia.dev) and [Google Arts & Culture](artsandculture.google.com).

In a former academic life, I was a Research Assistant in [Peter Sewell](www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20)'s team at the [University of Cambridge](www.cl.cam.ac.uk).

I did my PhD thesis at [Université Paris Diderot](irif.fr) under the direction of [Juliusz Chroboczek](irif.fr/~jch).
