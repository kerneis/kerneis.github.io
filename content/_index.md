## About

I like working with complex systems that interact in odd ways and break creatively
when you pay too much, or not enough, attention.
Currently, this involves mostly firmwares and humans.

Notable recent open-source contributions:

* [chipsec-check maintainer](https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/chipsec-check)
* [AMD support for chipsec](https://github.com/chipsec/chipsec/issues/825)
* [HSI checks for fwupd](https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Akerneis-anssi)
